# tutorials
Repo for tutorials on frameworks and etc.

Each directory represents environment for one tutorial. Most of them are shipped with setup script (i.e. *[setup.sh](setup.sh)* in the directory), which sets the environment up.

Currently I am using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as the primary code editor, hence, I will ship tutorials with *[.vscode](.vscode)* folder, which contains VS Code files, which tell studio how to build/run the tutorial.
